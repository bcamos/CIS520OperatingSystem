/*
    Waits for a child process pid and retrieves the child's exit status.
    If pid is still alive, waits until it terminates.
    Then, returns the status that pid passed to exit.
    If pid did not call exit(), but was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due to an exception),
    wait(pid) must return -1. It is perfectly legal for a parent process to wait for child processes
    that have already terminated by the time the parent calls wait, but the kernel must still allow
    the parent to retrieve its child's exit status, or learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.

    wait must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following conditions is true:

    pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process.
    pid is a direct child of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid
    as a return value from a successful call to exec.
    Note that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child process C,
    then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to wait(C) by process A must fail.
    Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new parent if their parent process exits before they do.

    The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a process may wait for any given child at most once.
    Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order,
    and may even exit without having waited for some or all of their children.
    Your design should consider all the ways in which waits can occur.
    All of a process's resources, including its struct thread, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not,
    and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.

    You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.
    The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in userprog/process.c) from main() (in threads/init.c).
    We suggest that you implement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function
    and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().

    Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest.
